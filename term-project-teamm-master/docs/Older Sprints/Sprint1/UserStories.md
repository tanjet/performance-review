Meet Jack, a 28-year-old entrepreneur and the owner of "EventEase," an event management company located in Michigan. 
He holds a degree in business management and has been in the event management industry for five years, during which time 
he has earned a solid reputation in the area for delivering exceptional event experiences.

EventEase specializes in organizing a wide range of events, from weddings, birthdays, and anniversaries to funerals and 
parties. Initially, Jack started with smaller events, but he has recently expanded his services to include medium-sized 
events. With his growth, his team has now grown to 25 employees.

Recently, Jack took a significant step by launching the company's website, and he even completed a basic course on website 
management. However, Jack faces the challenge of maintaining his hard-earned reputation as he transitions into handling 
larger events and overseeing a larger team. The real challenge lies in evaluating the performance of his 25 employees, 
distinguishing between those who excel and those who may need improvement.

In his quest for a solution, Jack discovered a web app called "Performance Review." This app provides a platform where 
employees can provide reviews about their colleagues. Jack believes that implementing this app in his company could be a game-changer.
It would allow him to create groups with his 25 employees, enabling them to provide anonymous reviews about each other's performance.

Jack acknowledges that some employees may be hesitant to offer direct feedback, but the feature of anonymity in the app 
could encourage more honest and constructive feedback. By leveraging this app, Jack aims to gain valuable insights into 
the performance of his team, ensuring that his reputation remains intact as EventEase continues to grow and diversify its services.

John, as an HR manager, wants to easily create and manage performance review cycles for employees, including setting review 
periods and assigning reviewers. Supervisor Mike wants to be able to easily access and review his team members' performance
data and provide feedback within the app . As an employee, I want to have a centralized platform where I can view my review.
Our team leader wants to be able to compare performance data across team members to identify trends, strengths, and weaknesses.

Sarah, 28, is a marketing specialist living in the big apple, Silicon Valley. She completed her undergraduate degree in Marketing at the University of Texas and has been working in the digital marketing industry for 6 years. Sarah is a tech-savvy professional who has a keen eye for user experience and design. She loves exploring new web applications and platforms that can help streamline her work. She frequently needs to gather user feedback on various products and services. 

She saw the first version of our product and wants the following features. She proposed:   
1. **Customization Options**: As a marketing specialist, I often need to add a professional touch to my reviews. Being able to add a profile picture, a short bio, and perhaps a link to various social medias will help me understand my clients better.  
2. **Moderation and Reporting**: Given the public nature of the reviews, a robust moderation and reporting system is essential. It would be reassuring to shoot down inappropriate content or spam.  
3. **Draft functionality**: As a marketer, I need to assure that my clients are most cooperative with handing in reviews. Writing a long, well thought-out review might take longer than one seating. A "save-draft" function will encourage my clients to write and submit reviews.  
4. **Design**: As a marketing specialist, I take user experience and perception seriously. Currently, the design of the product is rudimentary, so some more styling would add to the user experience.

Kora is the founder of The SMILEY Financial Firm. She is interested in having her staff make use of a performance review
application in which staff can highlight each other's achievements, through the use of not only text but also photos. 
Kora also realizes some staff members will want to write less positive reviews about their co-workers. 
She would like for staff to be able to privately message reviews in case the information within the review is sensitive.
