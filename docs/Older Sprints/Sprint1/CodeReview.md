# Code Review 

**Recorded by:** Turjo  
**Date:** 14 October 2023

# Project Progress and Approach:
Our team has made significant progress in developing the Performance Review web-based app. 
Turjo has successfully set up the server, enabling seamless communication for our application. 
Daniel has constructed the HTML and implemented a robust templating engine, providing a foundation for the app's frontend logic. 
Caleb has established the data store and object mapping, crucial for managing and organizing our application's data.
Tanjet has been instrumental in developing user info and security features, focusing on safeguarding user data and access. 

Currently, we have a functional server and a structured HTML layout for the application. 
Connections between various components are established, allowing us to access essential user information through the implemented logic.


* During our SCRUM meetings, we consistently present and discuss code contributions. The entire team is informed about the progress and actively participates in discussions.

* We have prioritized adherence to SOLID principles and de-coupling to ensure a maintainable and scalable codebase.

* Before merging any code, a comprehensive review is conducted. We did this to catch potential issues and validate the code.

* We have successfully established and enforced pull request deadlines. 

# Future Plans:
Moving forward, we plan to collaboratively work on the application's logic to integrate the server functionality with the HTML structure.
We will implement the app's logic, and focus on user information and security features.
