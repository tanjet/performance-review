## Performance review by Tridib Paul Turjo
I'm delighted that we managed to meet the professor's requirements in the first sprint cycle. Initially, I had concerns 
about our project's progress, especially when everyone had plans during the midterm break, making it difficult to coordinate. 
This made me worry about our ability to complete the project on time. However, it's worth noting that we had a functional
server and a login HTML page, thanks to Daniel's contributions before the break.

Daniel, in particular, has been a valuable asset to the group. His prior knowledge of HTML, coupled with his online course 
experience, made the HTML development phase seamless. He's truly passionate about computer science, actively participating 
in group work and assisting me in resolving errors.

Caleb's dedication is truly exceptional; he invested time in mastering SQL to develop our project's database, a substantial
contribution that greatly enhanced our project's performance. Moreover, his commitment to clarifying his code thoroughly 
has helped the team better understand the SQL components of our project. His extensive effort and time spent on the project 
are indeed noteworthy.

Tanjet's contributions to the team are commendable. He has excelled in developing app logics and is dedicated to 
maintaining our project documentation with precision. His commitment to ensuring accurate and error-free documentation is
highly valuable to the team's success.

While we haven't encountered any major issues so far, we do have occasional disagreements about implementation. However,
we've always managed to find a solution in the end. Our main challenge has been coordinating our time for collaborative work,
but I appreciate that most of our progress was achieved during our meetings. We've all put in a significant amount of effort
for this course, and I'm optimistic that we can successfully complete it.



## Performance review by Daniel Cho
I am pleased working with my teammates and how our first cycle turned out.

In the initial process, Caleb has volunteered and took the initiative to work on our Database. He decided on SQL, which he has never used before. 
Caleb successfully learned and implemented the necessary functions and tables necessary, and requested, by his teammates.
Caleb continuously made sure that all everyone was on the same page during all our group meetings.
He is a good communicator and team player.

Turjo had been a valuable asset to our team. He set up the bottle framework on day one and kickstarted the project.
He took lead in documentation, and he made sure everyone supplied the appropriate documents via Kanban, comments, or documents.
Throughout the whole process, Turjo was quick to read the latest updates on the professor's homepage and understanding the specifications.  
Turjo has been present in all the meetings, and has been readily available for collaberation and support.

Tanjet worked indirectly with me, and more directly with Turjo and Caleb. However, to my limited observation, I'm pleased with Tanjet's cooperation.
Tanjet was the initial designer for the data structures. He is easy to work with, and he delivers code and results in a timely manner. 
Tanjet has shown good documentation skills and support for his teammates.

Caleb has been a SQL master and has made impressive progress in our database implementation. His contribution to the app logic has been invaluable. 

Daniel has been a great team member, providing structure and guidance for our project. His coding experience has been a major asset to the team, and he's always ensured the code is clean and organized. 

Turjo is a creative thinker, constantly coming up with fantastic ideas and features for our project. Even though our collaboration has been limited, his strong and helpful opinions shine through. 

Overall, I feel lucky to work with such amazing teammates who have made our server implementation successful.



## Performance review by Caleb Doupe
Overall I am very happy with the progress our team made during our first sprint and how we cooperated with each other.

Daniel did a fantastic job implementing his code on the project. He was very organized and on topic during the project. 
He displayed several leader based qualities, and did a great job bringing the group together.

Turjo was very patient and dedicated throughout the entirety of our sprint. If he struggled on a concept, we could always
rely on him to find a solution. Turjo acted as a great scrum master by keeping us on track and focused on our deliverables.

Tanjet did a great job implementing the tasks he was assigned and providing support. While he wasn't as vocal or present 
as the rest of the group members, he would always provide assistance when he could and implement his tasks in a timely manner.
