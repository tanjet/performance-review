## SPRINT 2


## Performance review by Caleb Doupe
Sprint 2 has progressed much better than sprint 1 for our team. During this sprint, the process felt smoother. This isn't
to say we didn't run into issues, but that it was a more comfortable experience.

Daniel continued to help do a great job keeping us on track and organized throughout the sprint. He provided a lot of help
and support when he was asked. He was patient and effective when implementing his code.

Turjo provided a lot of support throughout the sprint, and also kept us organized throughout. He handled the routing and POSTMAN
side of the project well and within a suitable time frame. 

Tanjet effectively completed the tasks he was assigned in a timely manner. He still was not as vocal in meetings as the other
group members, but he was very cooperative and he was more present in our meetings than last sprint.


## Performance review by Tanjet
Our team has shown a significant amount of progress, which is evident when looking at our code and design. 
Daniel did a great job formatting our website. He has been a valuable team player, always available when the team needed him.
He provided assistance in formatting my HTML page, and I'm grateful for his help. Daniel consistently offered feedback and suggestions whenever needed.

Turjo was also a good team player, providing feedback to enhance our project and sharing helpful ideas.

Caleb has been a reliable team member, consistently completing his tasks on time. He regularly reported issues and difficulties, seeking help when needed. Caleb contributed to improving our database and assisted in implementing methods and features.

### Overview

Our second sprint was marked by significant growth and the inevitable challenges that come with scaling a project. Despite facing issues with code maintenance and meeting 
coordination, our team successfully met the sprint goals within the set timeframe, showcasing our resilience and adaptability.

### Team Member Contributions
Daniel: Daniel's contribution remained integral to our progress. His skills in HTML development and session management
were crucial in keeping the project on track. However, a communication gap led to some duplicated efforts, which we addressed and rectified. 
This incident underscored the importance of clear and frequent communication within the team.

Caleb: Caleb continued to impress with his dedication to the project's database development. His initiative to restructure the entire database for better e
fficiency and performance was a significant undertaking that paid off. His efforts not only improved our project but also kept the team aligned with our goals.

Tanjeet: Tanjeet maintained his consistent performance, meeting all his deadlines. However, his engagement in team meetings could be more proactive. 
Increased participation would likely bring more diverse ideas and strengthen our project further.

### Challenges and Approaches
Managing Code Complexity: As our project expanded, we faced difficulties in managing an increasingly complex codebase. We spent considerable time decoupling and 
ensuring that every feature worked seamlessly.

Improving Meeting Efficiency: Our meetings, though productive, were lengthy. Going forward, we plan to implement more structured agendas to make our meetings shorter and more efficient.

### Conclusion
Overall, our team has demonstrated commendable dedication and skill in navigating the challenges of this sprint. With a focus on improving communication and meeting efficiency, 
I am confident that we are well-positioned to excel in our final sprint and deliver a successful project.

I feel like I know my teammates more, and it’s great to see my teammates and me learning how to cooperate with each other. Overall, I think it was a successful sprint.  

Caleb was easily accessible, and he came to every meething I can think of. When I needed restructuring of the Database, he would deliever the product in a prompt manner.  He is reliable and diligent. He showed lots of qualities of a leader by taking the initiative to learn the new requirements that popped up each class. He was swift to learn the UML and other documentation tasks that were required.  Caleb is a responsible teammate.   

Turjo was easily accessible, and he showed a keen interest in learning new technologies. Turjo worked with me with the application logic and HTML. For one of the features (save draft), he was able to implement a functionality that I gave up on. Turjo shows grit and determination as a programmer. Turjo also took the initiative to ask the professor concerning difficulties the team had. He is always looking out for the team.  

Tanjett was cooperative, and showed up to almost all the meetings which was a big improvement from sprint1. Tanjett is a good listener. During our sprint, he demonstrated a diverse coding ability by implementing the “change password” in HTML, bottle, and database methods.
