# Project Progress and Approach:
During our final sprint for the COMP2005 course project, we not only fine-tuned our web application but also expanded our architectural documentation to reflect the advanced stages of our development 
process. We introduced a new component architecture document enriched with an updated UML diagram that provides a detailed depiction of our application's structure. We also revisited our development process, creating a new process analysis
diagram that captures the essence of our workflow and the methodologies employed throughout the project lifecycle.

Our progress was marked by several milestones:
- The development and inclusion of a comprehensive microservice architecture design, offering a hypothetical alternative to our existing components-based approach, showcasing how our application could be evolved in the future.
- Finalization of core features like user profile management, edit exiting post, comment functionality and anonymous reviews, ensuring functional completeness and user privacy.
- Enhanced session management and a polished user interface, culminating in a secure and seamless user experience.
- Thorough testing procedures, affirming the application’s readiness for deployment and its adherence to our high standards for quality and reliability.


The approach we've taken reflects the sophisticated practices explored in our coursework, with a strong emphasis on scalability, maintainability, and adherence to industry-standard architectural patterns.

# Future Plans:
As this sprint concludes our active development phase, we have equipped our project with extensive documentation that showcases our growth as a team and our application’s robust architecture. The inclusion of the microservice architecture 
design in our final documentation serves as a testament to our ability to adapt and plan for scalable solutions.

Looking ahead, we intend to:

- Apply our understanding of both component-based and microservice architectures in future software endeavors, leveraging the versatility and depth of our skills.
- Use the comprehensive documentation, including our microservice architecture design, as a reference model for best practices in software development.
- Maintain the agile and collaborative team dynamics that have underpinned the success of this project, recognizing their value in future group collaborations.

While there are no immediate plans to continue the development of this application as it is a course project, the skills, knowledge, and teamwork experiences we have gained are invaluable assets that we will carry forward into our professional careers. 
The project stands as a beacon of our collective learning and a springboard for our future endeavors in the tech industry.
